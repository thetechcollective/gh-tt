`gh-tt` is inherently a relatively thin wrapper around `git` and `gh` commands. Therefore, some mechanism to efficiently call out to the shell is needed.

At the center stands the `Gitter` class which executes shell commands and returns the results in a concurrent-friendly way.

The second component the `Lazyload` class which allows getting and setting properties, recursively executing and resolving commands through `Gitter`.

I am quite happy with how `Gitter` works - however, IMO, `Lazyload` combined with class-stored state leads to stringly-typed commands, implicit dependencies and large cognitive overhead.

This refactor has the following goals:
- reduce state (easier testing)
- reduce cognitive load (ide support, better typing)
- no loss in performance

# gh-semver

**This utility is desinged as a GitHub Command Line extension.**

Install:

```
gh extension install thetechcollective/gh-tt
```

The extension requires that you have write access to projects too

Run `gh tt -h` to learn the syntax

## Note
It's written in Python and runs in a `pipenv` so it doesn't leave any footprint or alterization to your own, current Python setup. All requirements besides `python3` are managed independenly by the script itself.
